TowerWiki and EnemyWiki show basic information about unit class
Units with the same symbol start with the written characteristic
All presented Units can appear during the game

Shown statistics: TowerWiki
(sym) Symbol = symbol denoting that unit
(type) Type = 1-ground; 2-air; 3-universal; B-basic->attacks one unit at a time; S-splash->attacks all units in range
(dmg) Damage = damage per hit to enemy units
(cld) Cooldown = Tower fires once per 'n' steps (1 step = enemies move to neighbouring field)
(rng) Range = how far can tower attack (in fields)
(cost) Cost = how many Coins does the tower cost to build

Shown statistics: TowerWiki
(sym) Symbol = symbol denoting that unit
(HP) Health Points = how much Damage may unit recieve before it is defeated
(path) Path = which algorithm unit uses to cross the map
  -> BR - follows walls/towers by its right hand avoiding towers (in a sense that they do not step on fields where a tower is)
  -> BL - follows walls/towers by its left hand avoiding towers (in a sense that they do not step on fields where a tower is)
  -> BFS = Breadth First Search - shortest path avoiding towers (in a sense that they do not step on fields where a tower is)
  -> AIR - shortest path ignoring towers
(type) Type = 1-ground; 2-air
(pts) Points = reward added to Coins and Score for defeating that enemy unit


Map: shows progress during the game
START always points inwards, END outwards (symbols <,^,>,V)

Control Keys:

Main Menu:
'Up; and 'Down' arrow keys for moving
'Enter' for continuing with highlighted choice

Help:
- scrolling the manual with 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys
- terminal window size can be changed while viewing the Help manual, but than, please, restart the game

Field for user input (for saving and loading games):
- allowed input = keys with graphical symbols + 'Spacebar'
- moving cursor with 'Left' and 'Right' arrow keys
- delete characters by 'Backspace' and 'Delete' keys
- press 'Enter' to confirm the input
- press 'Esc' to invalidate input (end of input (Ctrl+d) invalidates input)
for confirming overwriting saved file 'y' or 'n' keys are requested

!! Warning !!
The response after pressing 'Esc' key is slower than by pressing other keys.

Preparation Phase:
- uses folloing keys
h/H = Help
b/B = Building Regime
n/N = Next turn -> go to Defence phases
s/S = Save game
q/Q = Quit game -> go to Main Menu

Building regime:
- move cursor with arrow keys
- build a tower by pressing key with character corresponding to symbol of that tower
-> e.g. Build a tower with symbol 'A' by pressing A (Shift+a)
-> tower is build on the position of the cursor
-> must be build on empty field, with corresponding funds, while preserving a road for enemies that they still can reach END
- exit Building regime by pressing 'Esc'
- delete a tower by pressing 'del' key
-> tower on on thw field of the cursor is dismantled and part of its building cost is returned to Coins  

Defence phase:
-fully autonomous, player can speed up this phase by pressing any key, but cannot be stopped
